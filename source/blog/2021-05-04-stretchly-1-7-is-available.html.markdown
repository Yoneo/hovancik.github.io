Hi everyone,

I am really happy to announce, that **version 1.7 of [*Stretchly*](/stretchly) is here!** You can download it from [downloads](/stretchly/downloads) page.

Thanks to everyone for their [support](/stretchly/sponsor)!

### Added
- advanced preferences for Pause/Resume Breaks global shortcuts
- advanced preferences for picking monitor to show break on
- added initial support for the RTL languages for the UI

### Changed
- endBreakShortcut can be set to empty string, thus disabled
- updated many translations

### Fixed
- prevent memory leak after break has ended
