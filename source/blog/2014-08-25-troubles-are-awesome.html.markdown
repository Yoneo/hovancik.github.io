Straight to the point: **my laptop is broken**. 

It seems that this kind of stuff happens always when I don't need it. Like now, when I wanted to make a few posts about coding BSDSec.

Argh.  


But *still*, troubles are aweosme...

And I don't mean to be satirical or that kind of stuff. Life *might* be better without troubles, but also boring.

So be thankful for your troubles. In the end, everything is always only in your head and it depends only on you how you want to deal with stuff happening around you.

Let's enjoy it. (My eyes *are* enjoying less of time spent with technology.)
