## So recently I became obsessed with Podcasts. A lot.

I guess I needed a break from people. Or listen to some different kind of people. Or not at all.


Anyway, in last few days, I added a bunch of podcasts to my manager and one of them was Design Vs Dev, a podcast about web development from the different perspectives of designers and developers.
It's awesome. It comes from [company](http://agileleague.com/) that is working with Ruby On Rails and *'hey, that's what I do, right?'*. That might be very useful for me.

This week episode is called [CSS Preprocessors â€“ LESS and SASS](http://agileleague.com/blog/design-vs-dev-episode-2-css-preprocessors-less-sass/) and what they talked about is...

...obvious.

I was aware of existence of SASS and LESS, but never really looked more deeply into it. Somehow I was under impression they are not that useful. But guys from podcast made me feel different. And it makes sense, writing CSS isn't heaven...

That's not the only thing that made me think differently. I always thought that Rails community is very tightly in friendship with [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). Well, seems like I was wrong.

[ZURB!](http://foundation.zurb.com/)

So guess what? My next Rails project will be with Zurb Foundation and SASS.
