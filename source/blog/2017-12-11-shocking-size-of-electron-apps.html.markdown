Last week I received this email:


```
from: U884862107693 <gKdeNUHMYr@protonmail.ch>
subject: Stretchly

Hello.

Your small program (Stretchly) has a very shocking size (108 MB). Do you think that this is the normal size for such a low-functionality program?

You're not a programmer. You are fucking idiot. You need to work as a waiter in McDonalds, not write a programs.

If you do not rewrite your program so that it does not have such a large size, I will come to you and fuck you. I'll fuck you till you love me.


Bye.
```

Few things:

- even thought he is right about the size of the app (because of electron), there's no way of making it smaller by being vulgar
- by being vulgar he made my day
- I guess better not to answer (but I swear I have like 100 ideas + (100 from my girlfriend) how to answer him - that would be fun)

Anyway... I might do it...
