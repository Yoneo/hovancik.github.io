Hi there guys, I am really happy to release version 0.7.0 of [*stretchly*](/stretchly). You can download it from [github](https://github.com/hovancik/stretchly/releases/tag/v0.7.0).

*stretchly* is cross-platform open source app that reminds you to take breaks when working with computer.

### Changed
- app windows are shown on the monitor where the mouse is (Windows, macOS)
- reminders can be full screen
- About and Settings windows are not resizable and not always on top
- `Quit` -> `Quit stretchly` menu item text
- replaced `splash of cappuccino` with `graphite crystal` theme

### Added
- monochrome icon for macOS (also @2x)

### Removed
- Settings window notification
- Startup window

Many thanks goes to [Alex Alekseyenko](https://github.com/alexalekseyenko) who implemented some of those features.
