I'd like to think I was very good child. Except when it comes to breaking some stuff.

Some very specific stuff: Football (or any other) balls.

Not that I *wanted*, but I *did* broke more than a few of them.
And I remember being very scared about it.
First of all it was happening quite often, and then there was always some punishment.
And not physical only, as I always felt that my parents are dissapointed when I broke one. So I was always afraid to tell them.

This short poem is in Slovak, but some might be able to read it. Or one day I'll translate it.

ako deti  
sme stavali domčeky z piesku a nahí  
tancovali vzadu na dvore  

presne na tom istom mieste  
kde teraz nič nie je  

díval som sa na teba  
a všetko bolo dôležité tulene v zoo aj  
mravce čo sme pálili iba z radosti  

*mama, zase som dotrhal loptu,*  
plakal som
