Normal Mode is the default mode. It's roughly equivalent to the state that other editors are in when you're holding down the ctrl or cmd keys. Instead of entering text onto the screen, different keys trigger different commands. Initially this is a bit weird. Those of us coming from other editors or IDEs are used to being able to type text by default. The thought is that adding text is the primary task in a text editor. But Vim treats adding text as sitting on equal footing with editing, deleting and manipulating existing text, and starts us in a mode where we can quickly make any change. To steal an analogy from Drew Neil, normal mode is the opportunity to take our paintbrush off the canvas while we decide our next stroke.

Insert mode is the equivalent of most editor's normal state. When you type a key in normal mode, it appears on the screen. You can enter insert mode by pressing i in visual mode, and exit it by hitting <esc>.

Command line mode lets you enter ex-commands, a command line language that complements normal modes shortcuts. You enter it by hitting : in normal mode. Important commands are :w to write (save) a file, and :q! to quit.
