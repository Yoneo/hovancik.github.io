I'm really happy to announce that [DiscoverBSD](https://discoverbsd.com) can now be found on Mastodon.

To be more precise, on [bsd.network](https://bsd.network/) instance as [@discoverbsd](https://bsd.network/@discoverbsd) or [@discoverbsd@bsd.network](https://bsd.network/@discoverbsd).

Hope to talk to you there, all articles will be posted there the same as on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_DiscoverBSD).
