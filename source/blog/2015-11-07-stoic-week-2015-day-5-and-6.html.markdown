Not so much to report here: Yesterday I haven't found time to read After lunch exercise so I read it today. And exercise for today.

It's going the similar way as my previous blogposts: I find stoic ideas very close to mine and to the mindfulness.

I recommend doing the exercises yourself. My eyes are somehow ubertired, so that's it for today.
