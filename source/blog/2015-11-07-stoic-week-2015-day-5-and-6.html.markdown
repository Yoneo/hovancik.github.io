Not so much to report here: Yesterday I haven't found time to read After lunch excercise so I read it today. And excercise for today. 

It's going the similar way as my previous blogposts: I find stoic ideas very close to mine and to the mindfulness. 

I recommend doing the excerices yourself. My eyes are somehow ubertired, so that's it for today.
