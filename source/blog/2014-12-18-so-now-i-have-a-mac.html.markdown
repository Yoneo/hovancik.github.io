## And I think I like it.

At least so far. It's for sure upgrade from what I had before (Gateway NV52u) so do I have a choice?

Sure I don't. (And btw I got 2,6 i5, 256SSD overpriced 2014 macbook pro)

* Retina is amazing. I was impressed when I saw it for the first time. Thought, I would like to see its competitors.
* Set up was typical, I guess, asking for visa card  details. OK, not so typical for Linux or BSD.  
* Sound is a bit better than what I've heard before in laptops.
* Gestures seems to be fun (finally I wont be using mouse?)
* Da fuck is wrong Store? Weird way of installing stuff in general.
* CMD and CTRL. Ahhh.

Yeah and so. I have it for few days only, so let's see how it goes.
It's Unix, we should get along just fine.

### And why I bought it?
Well, in my next workplace everyone is using it. With Rails, the most of people are using it. I should give it a chance.
