I'll have to admit that I pretty much don't remember why, but few days ago my
girlfriend and I decided to start to learn [Elixir programming language](http://elixir-lang.org/) together.

Probably because I've tried to do that alone some time ago, but I gave up after
quite short time. I didn't manage to force my self to keep learning and after
a while I was *forgetting* more that I was *learning*.

You see, learning something new is always a good thing, but one needs a motivation to keep up. And what's better motivation than learning with someone else? Someone you have near you all the time?

That would be my girlfriend, right? I am software developer, she is not, this should be fun!

### The plan.

The plan is rather simple. We bought [Elixir book](https://pragprog.com/book/elixir/programming-elixir) and slowly we are going to read it.

She is not a software developer so we should both learn a lot. She, because she is doing something totally new, and me, because when trying to explain to her, I will need to look up a lot of stuff. At least I think so. I mean I'm pretty sure there's a lot of things I can not explain because my understanding of them is very tiny.

### So.

So I will be writing here. She will be writing as well. There [On the shelf](http://ontheshelf.github.io/). I hope you are going there right now and will make some comments.

Part of learning is *making mistakes* and that's where you can help us.
