The most of the apps/websites I run are in Ruby on Rails (RoR) and everytime there is a new major release I upgrade them. It's also time to think about where they are going.

Back in August, when they made RoR 6.0 public, I've upgraded [DiscoverBSD](https://discoverbsd.com/), [Lem](https://lemur.app) and [stretchly server](https://my.stretchly.net/), but I was very successfully procrastinating on [BSDSec](https://bsdsec.net). In last few days, finally, I have forced myself to upgrade it.

And it was indeed successful exercise. Not only had I chance to use some of new RoR features, but I also had time to see some of BSDSec's problems (social sharing, design, code debt) and think about it's future.

As it goes hand-in-hand with DiscoverBSD, I am thinking to reuse the design of DiscoverBSD (but change the primary color to some different one) and somehow connect them (probably as menu items).

Let's see...
