## Or This Week I Learned

### Languages
We speak them.

And then there's that really [great game](https://greatlanguagegame.com/) you should check out. It is fun.

###`python -m SimpleHTTPServer 5000`
This is the one you always use. But there is also one in ruby: `ruby -run -e httpd . -p 5000`

### Marihuana
Ah, there is [a link](http://healthland.time.com/2011/04/06/why-pot-smokers-are-paranoid/) between paranoia and marihuana usage. Not cool.   
Is it the same with alcohol? I would like to know, but am lazy to search for it.  

### ... and some podcasts
* [StarTalk Radio: The Science of Family Guy with Seth MacFarlane](https://soundcloud.com/startalk/the-science-of-family-guy-with-seth-macfarlane)
* [Planet Money: The Great Inflation](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/11/20/456855788/episode-664-the-great-inflation)
