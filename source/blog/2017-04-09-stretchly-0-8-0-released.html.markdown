Hi there guys, I am really happy to release version 0.6.0 of [*stretchly*](/stretchly). You can download it from [github](https://github.com/hovancik/stretchly/releases/tag/v0.6.0).

*stretchly* is cross-platform open source app that reminds you to take breaks when working with computer.

- time remaining and progress bar in break window

### Fixed
