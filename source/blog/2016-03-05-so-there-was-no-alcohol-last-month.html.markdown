## And sweets as well.

And it was interesting, indeed. I did keep the promise and during February (*the shortest month, right?*) there was no alcohol and sweets for me.

### What did I expect?
 * Spend less money
 * loose weight
 * feel better overall
 * sleep better
 * have **worse social life**

And stuff like that.

### What was the reality?

Some things are obvious: I did spend less money. Same goes with other stuff: I slept better, I was not tired during workdays (before, I usually had to eat some sweet stuff afternoon, my body demanded it.). Eat more fruits!

#### Weight.
I went down to **67kg from 71kg**. Nice.

It's also because there were Christmas not that long ago, but anyway, it makes me happy. Loosing some weight was something that I wanted. And I was not changing any of my eating habits, except sugar. I might even ate more fast food than usually.


#### Alcohol.

I thought that this might be hard, but in the end, it wasn't. I still did not drink anything, yet. Didn't really had taste for beer or so.

Kinda strange.

#### So.

So social life: was OK, not that awkward. There were not that much parties, I was doing other stuff instead. Might see less people.

### Next?

This experiment was great. Hopefully I will do more of this stuff in future. Like take a walk everyday, exercise in the morning and evening.. and so...
