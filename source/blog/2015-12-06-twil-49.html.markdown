## Or This Week I Learned

This week we have been talking (home at [6artisans](http://6artisans.cz)) about how to work better. You know, how to have more fun, learn more and do things better.

All the companies should.

Anyway, I've been reading a lot articles and so on: about testing, deploying, etc. Just wanna shout out one awesome [article](http://www.be9.io/2015/12/01/heroku-deployment/). Great inspiration if you are looking for way how to do your development (heroku, aws, migrations, jenkins, hubot, etc.).  

It goes into much details, so *yay!*.

### And obligatory podcasts:
* [On the Maintenance of Civilization: Sam Harris](http://www.samharris.org/podcast/item/on-the-maintenance-of-civilization/) - In this episode of the Waking Up podcast, Sam Harris speaks with author Douglas Murray about Islamism, liberalism, civil society, and the migrant crisis in Europe.
* some scifi and fantasy stories: [The Light Brigade - Lightspeed Magazine](http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/the-light-brigade/), [Drabblecast 372 - Delicate Parts](http://www.drabblecast.org/2015/11/27/drabblecast-372-delicate-parts/)

## And Christmas pics because it's that time of year.  
And we made our flat look better with my amazing girlfriend.
