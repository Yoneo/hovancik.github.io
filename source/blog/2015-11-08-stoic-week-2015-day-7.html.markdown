### 11.55AM

Yay, today is the first day I am actually doing After Lunch exercise after lunch.

And the topic is: our place within nature as a whole. Good way to end this week, putting it all together and taking a look from the above. All starts to fit in, making sense as whole. The stoicism, I mean.

When we look from above, we can realize how small we are. But more importantly we can see that we are part of something bigger. The universe can be our moral inspiration.

How can universe be moral inspiration, you ask? Well, the qualities they attributed to the universe as a whole were order, structure and rationality. So pretty much the same attributes as they say we should have to live a happy life. I very like them taking inspiration from place where they are [The Universe].

That makes much sense.
