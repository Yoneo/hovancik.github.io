So now I really think every new day is answer to my previous days arguments and questions. *Neat.*

For stoics the core virtues are wisdom, moderation, courage, and justice. And that they are a matched set, mutually supporting, so that you could not have one without the others. But the most importantly by having them, one will also be good at doing everything else in life.

That answers my criticism about why they are trying to 'live good life'. Interesting concept, indeed.

But there one more idea in today's After-lunch exercise that I love. Stoics say that we are unhappy because what we do and what we think is not the same thing. Eg: you believe you should help elderly, but in reality you don't. That makes you unbalanced.

**In our life, we should follow our core values, otherwise we wont be happy.**

That's exactly where my early-puberty reflections ended up, so I totally agree.
