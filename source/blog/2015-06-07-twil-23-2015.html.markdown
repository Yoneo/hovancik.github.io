## Or This Week I Learned

It's been again few weeks, but anyway, it's been a lot of new interesting stuff there. Some I even managed to write down so I can share it with you...

### [The Wolfram Language Image Identification Project](https://www.imageidentify.com/)
Yes, I did try some pervert images.

### [Domain names](https://www.ietf.org/edu/documents/80DNS-Koch-Gudmundsson.pptx)
Domain names are case insensitive for [A-Z][a-z], case sensitive for others ( exämple.com!= exÄmple.com).  

### [Interesting game](https://godvillegame.com/)
So called "ZPG" - or the game you do not need to play. Uber cool. Try if you have time.  
Wait, even if you don't. It plays by itself.

### Ducks
Go ahead and watch them while they play in water. At least it looks like they play. They enjoy the hell out of flying and I am not surprised.  
I wanna be duck in my next life. (Not that I believe in next lifes.)

### [Time-lapse Mining from Internet Photos](http://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/timelapse/)
This was mentioned in awesome [SGU](http://www.theskepticsguide.org/) podcast. Scary, but amazing what they managed to do.

### [uBlock](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) and [uMatrix](https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix)
Finally I have found the ad-blocker extension that does what I want. I use uMatrix only, as it also has features from uBlock.
uMatrix is a firewall which works in relaxed block-all/allow-exceptionally mode.

### Baby elephants eat the feces of their mums to get the right bacteria.
So that the bacteria kickstarts their digestive system.

### `rake test folder/*`
If you run `rake test folder/`, it will run all the tests. Add `*` to run only test within directory f your choice.
