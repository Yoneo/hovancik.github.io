*Hi there guys,*
*I would like to announce the little hobby project I've been working for some time now: [BSDSec.net][1]*

It's very-alfa but let's talk about why and so.

**Prelude:**

I might be administrator of more BSD-based systems. I want to check fresh Security Advisories (SA) and Announcements (A) very often.

**How I do it now:**

1. I might be checking Websites of single BSD projects for latest SA and A.
2. I might have subscribed to mailing lists of those BSD projects.
3. I might be checking twitter or other media (IRC as well)


**Problem:**

As you might imagine, all of them might bring some non-comfort. I might miss emails, be lazy to check more websites (some might have not be nice to my eyes) and so on. I am human, anyway. I would like to have some easy way.

**Wanna-be Solution**

[BSDSec.net][2]

As title says, website want to be "deadsimple BSD Security Advisories and Announcements"

**Current status:**

SA and A from: *OpenBSD*, *FreeBSD*, *NetBSD*.
DragonFly BSD doesn't seems to have any platform for SA. Need to check the rest.

I take SA and A, and publish them on BSDSec.net website. Aim for website is to be very simple,  intuitive and mobile-whatever frendly. Tags are available for better search (in case you want only FreeBSD). I also publish on [Twitter][3]. Discussion is available via [Reddit][4].

All process is done by my application, so I do not need to do anything.

**How it works?**

App is open-source, built with Ruby on Rails.  I will write details in my next post, as well with how-to on contributing and so. I have few ideas and anyone is welcome to join me and make this app better!

**Any criticism very welcome!**
Do criticise, please!

(And share if you find this useful.)

Thanks,
