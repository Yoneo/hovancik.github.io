*Three months ago I started to work as a Proxy Product Owner (Proxy PO), so I thought it might be interesting to reflect on it and maybe write a thing or two about it, for the benefit of other people starting in a similar role or me coming back later.*

### So what's a Proxy PO?

If you want a specific definition, you can find a couple of them online...  But, for context of this article, **Proxy PO is a member of an agile team, with a subset of responsibilities and powers of a PO**. PO should still be part of the team, so one might use this role when PO can not fully concentrate on a product (eg. she has multiple ones), is not co-located with the rest of a team, and so on.

### 1.

When I started to search for a PM/PO job about a half year ago, I didn't even know that such a role existed. When I looked up a definition, the consensus (= few articles I read, so I might be totally off) seemed to be that it's not really a good role to be in, because you hardly have real ownership and people might look at you as an assistant/secretary to the PO.

After 3 months I can tell that that's not true: **Whether you're PO, PM, Proxy PO, or developer; how much ownership over a product you can yield only depends on the amount you're willing to take and to demand.**

You might not always be as successful in getting it as you would like to, but, more often then not, it's just a question of time. Why would you get hired otherwise?

### 2.

That leads to the second point: **Trust required for ownership is not an easy thing to get.** But don't worry, you can help yourself by doing what you're already good at.

### 3.

And that's figuring out *people*'s needs. I am not *not using* word *customer* by accident, because by *people* I mean your stakeholders, PO, testers; basically everyone. **Treat your organization and your team as you would a customer: understand their problems and then prioritize solving them.** In most cases, this will move the product forward as well.

A word of warning, though: Make sure people want your help.

### 4.

**Start at an interview.** That's the one trick I can't recommend enough:  try to figure out what kind of problems they are looking to solve with the role, then ask yourself whether that's interesting for you.

### 5.

Being "only" a Proxy might be even good for you. **It's always easier to assert ownership over time than trying to hold on to it from day one.** Being Proxy also gives you more freedom to pick up stuff you're more comfortable with.

### Summa summarum

Summa summarum, I am pretty happy with the last three months. If you see such a role being advertised, it's definitely worth interviewing.
