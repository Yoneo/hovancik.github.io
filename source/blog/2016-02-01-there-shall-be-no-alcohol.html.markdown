##And sweets as well. 

So January was kinda weird: I did spend more on alcohol than on food. And I do not remember being drunk that much. There were some parties and so, but...  

That's not right. I mean, no headache? Just money spent? That for sure not right. 

###So this month will be different. 
I wont drink any alcohol, and as bonus, no sweets as well.

Let's see how that works.
