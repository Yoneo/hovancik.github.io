Hi there guys, I am really happy to release version 0.21.1 of [*stretchly*](/stretchly). You can download it from [downloads](/stretchly/downloads) page.

*stretchly* is cross-platform open source app that reminds you to take breaks when working with computer.

If you enjoy *stretchly*, consider becoming patron at [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/hovancik).

### Changed
- Italian translations updated
- break window is shown on all Workspaces in macOS
- Improved readability of English text

### Added
- user can set volume for break sounds (set via Settings file or Contributor's settings)
- user can set time after which breaks are paused in Natural Break (set via Settings file or Contributor's settings)

### Fixed
- texts appearing on top of each other in Settings for Chinese

If they are none critical problems with this release, I will start working on new *stretchly* version that I consulted with designer, meaning: *stretchly* will get UI/UX overhaul. It will probably become version 1.0.

Thanks to everyone for support on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/hovancik) and code contributions!
