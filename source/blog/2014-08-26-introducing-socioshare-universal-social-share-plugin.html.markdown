###universal social share plugin

I was fighting with myself recently over how to allow my readers (like there are many) to share my posts. 

Do I go for something fancy? Simple? Extremly simple? 

How much resources am I willing to lost? You know, the more fancy, the more it will kill my loading time. And that's not good. Big load time? I am gonna leave the page. 

So I decided to go extremly simple. The idea is, if someone really like the article and wants to share it, he will do more than one click. Frack fanciness. Anyway, I am trying to make whole website simple, right? 

If you keep reading till end, you will see what I did. And to allow you to do the same (in case you like it), I created [universal plugin](https://github.com/hovancik/SocioShare), so you can use it anywhere you want.
