Good news everyone, version 0.1.0 of *stretchly* is now available to be downloaded from [github](https://github.com/hovancik/stretchly/releases/tag/v0.1.0).

##What's new?
- rename strechly to stretchly (grammar, yay!)
- allows only one instance of app
- settings for microbreak (duration, interval)
- 5 color schemes

Unfortunately, there is some problem with Linux packages. When I tried on Ubuntu, app did not start. I'm working on it.
