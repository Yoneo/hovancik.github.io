## First things first.
Do you make resolutions for New Year? **I don't.**

Except this year. Or last year. Depending when do you consider "when".

Anyway, usually I don't, because I think they never work, it's stupid, and...  
And there's not a thing I wanna change right then, usually. Because if I wanna
change something, I'm just gonna change it whenever it comes to my mind.
No need to wait till the end of a year.

*Usually.*

So basically, the fact that I have one for 2016, is just good timing:
It was during christmas break and I wanted to make something
for my blog at [DiscoverBSD](https://discoverbsd.com).

### [DiscoverBSD Talks](https://talks.discoverbsd.com).

When I started the [blog](https://discoverbsd.com), idea was to learn more of
BSDs. I've kinda learnt a lot, but I guess, one can always learn more.
Like getting some books, going to conferences, attend meet-ups,
online stuff, etc..

Conferences are right now expensive for me, so I wanted another way to be
able to see what's up.  

### And luckily, a lot of talks can be found online.

Good for me right?

So right now the resolution is to watch one BSD-related conference
(or not from conference) talk every 2 weeks. And for that reason I am building
[DiscoverBSD Talks](https://talks.discoverbsd.com) website.
Sources are on [GitHub](https://github.com/DiscoverBSD/Talks).

Because, you know, it makes it easier for me to keep the resolution. I mean
I needed to build it, it's like my child and shit. And if some people join me, awesome.

### Because I can't do this alone.

Right now I hope it will become a community based website where
people can watch and discuss videos, and thus *learn*.

I plan to release new video every two weeks. To join me, you might want
to subscribe to get notified when new video is released
(via [email](http://eepurl.com/bHOOKz) or
[rss](https://talks.discoverbsd.com/feed.xml)).

### And please comment on videos

So we can all learn together. I am pretty sure that everyone will catch some different important detail.

### [First video](https://talks.discoverbsd.com/2016/01/01/early-days-of-unix-and-design-of-sh.html) is already out and you can learn some interesting stuff.

Like:  

 * Seventh edition #Unix release management: Utility owned by last person who touched it  
 * There were 40 system calls in Sixth edition #Unix 1975

**Go [watch](https://talks.discoverbsd.com/2016/01/01/early-days-of-unix-and-design-of-sh.html) to learn more!**
