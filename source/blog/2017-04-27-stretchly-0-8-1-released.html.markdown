Hi there guys, I am really happy to release version 0.8.1 of [*stretchly*](/stretchly). You can download it from [github](https://github.com/hovancik/stretchly/releases/tag/v0.8.1).

*stretchly* is cross-platform open source app that reminds you to take breaks when working with computer.

- after break ends, focus is brought on last window (macOS)

### Changed
- break windows are not focusable
- do not show break windows in taskbar
