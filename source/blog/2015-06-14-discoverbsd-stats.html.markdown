## Or some stats for DiscoverBSD, BSD-Links and BSDsec

So I was thinking a bit and decided: *why not to make some stats for my BSD projects?*

### [DiscoverBSD](https://www.DiscoverBSD.com) - Discovering the way of BSD
I started the blog in March 2013, so yay, it's more than 2 years now.

 * [Google+ Page](https://plus.google.com/+DiscoverBSD
) has 237 followers
 * [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/DiscoverBSD) has 71 likes
 * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_discoverbsd
) has 171 followers

The website itself gets around 30-50 visitors per day. Not much, but anyway, it's not that bad. It still makes sense for me to write. And the most of interactions I am getting from posting news on social media.
#### DiscoverBSD newsletter
You can now [subscribe](http://eepurl.com/bpsrfL) to the newsletter to get weekly updates from BSD world. It's the same as my weekly articles on website.
I have 1 subscriber as of now (I've just started, right?). It's automated, so I plan to keep it.

### [BSDSec](https://bsdsec.net) - deadsimple BSD Security Advisories and Announcements
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bsdsec
) has 51 followers
* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/bsdsec) has 27 readers. No comments though. I hoped to get some discussion there, but maybe one day...  

The website itself gets around 100 visitors when there are some new articles. It's all automated, so I guess there's no reason to shut it down.

The code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/hovancik/BSDSec), check it out, maybe you can make it better?

### [BSD-Links](https://github.com/DiscoverBSD/BSD-Links) - database of BSD related links
2 contributors as of now. Check what's missing and make a contribution.

## What's next?
Hard to say, I have some TODOs for these projects, so let's see how it goes. **But** I would be happy if I could find someone who wanna write for DiscoverBSD blog.
