If you're following [stretchly's newsletter](https://us11.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=7ce75bb5ad016b05238a9a095&id=49efaa672f) or if you are [my patron on Patreon](https://patreon.com/hovancik), you might have noticed the announcement: **Your stretchly is here!**

And as title says, it's for some time now. (Somehow I'm only writing this now...)

When announced, it was allowing my Patreon patrons to easily edit extra settings that were available only via editing [config file](https://github.com/hovancik/stretchly#advanced-settings) till then. Not all settings are there, yet, but plan is to have them all (plus a thing or two).

Here's a sneak peak:

Since initial announcement, I've also added authentication via Github, so anyone who contributed to *stretchly* can use *Your stretchly* as well.

Thanks for all of your support and I hope you will keep enjoying *stretchly* and *Your stretchly*!
