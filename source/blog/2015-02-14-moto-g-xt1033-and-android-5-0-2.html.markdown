## Or just fucking factory reset it.

Yea, so after my phone stolen in India last year, I decided I want something cheap and good. And mostly cheap.
So I got the Moto G, indian version, XT1033.

### How it worked with 4.4.4

As I don't play games and so, very well. No crashes, no lags, no freezing.

### How about 5.0.2?

Ah.  

I mean... *BAD!*

Apps crashing all the time, freezing, wifi going on and off.    
I lasted one week before doing factory reset. *And all works great now.*   

Moral? Just fucking factory reset it.

(Btw, update itself was non-problematic. Took about hour.)
