With the 2020 upon us, let's look at the most visited articles on the [DiscoverBSD](https://discovebsd.com) and [BSDSec](https://bsdsec.net) websites. Date of submission doesn't matter, we are only looking at number of visits (so some of the articles might be from 2018 or earlier...).

Thanks to everyone who submitted to DiscoverBSD and to all the good people working on BSD security teams!

## Top 10 DiscoverBSD

My subjective feeling is that the most of news submitted were FreeBSD related, but it seems that people are the most interested in OpenBSD related stuff.
